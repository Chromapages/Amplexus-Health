### 2.2 Services Grid (Detailed)

**Individual Therapy**

- **Subheading:** Individual Therapy  
- **Body Copy:**  
  Individual therapy offers a dedicated space to slow down, reflect, and be honest—without having to take care of anyone else in the room. Together with your therapist, you’ll explore your thoughts, feelings, and patterns at a pace that feels manageable, and work toward changes that support the life you want to build.

**Couples & Family Therapy**

- **Subheading:** Couples & Family Therapy  
- **Body Copy:**  
  Relationships can hold both comfort and tension. Couples and family therapy creates room for everyone’s voice, helping you identify patterns, improve communication, and move through conflict in a more connected way. The focus is not on assigning blame, but on understanding what’s happening between you and how to move forward together.

**Telehealth Therapy**

- **Subheading:** Telehealth Therapy  
- **Body Copy:**  
  Telehealth allows you to meet with your therapist from home or another private space using secure video. This option can be especially helpful if you have caregiving responsibilities, health concerns, or limited transportation. We’ll walk you through how to get set up, and you can always ask to revisit your comfort level with virtual sessions.

> Additional service types (e.g., groups, workshops, assessments) can be added with the same pattern.

### 2.3 Approach & Philosophy

How We Work

What this looks like in practice will depend on your needs, preferences, and identities. We check in regularly about how therapy feels and invite your feedback so we can adjust together.

> Note: Specific modalities and language should be adjusted to match the actual approaches used by the clinicians.
