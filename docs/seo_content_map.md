## 15. Notes & Implementation

- Keep title tags under ~60 characters and meta descriptions near 150–160 characters when possible.  
- Align H1 text with the copy deck for consistency; titles/meta can be slightly more keyword‑rich.  
- For local SEO, a future revision can add location keywords (e.g., city/region) once the practice finalizes how they want to present location online.
